            <p>Demon hunter who detests the darkness

                Alucard's father was a comrade-in-arms of Tigreal who disappeared in a battle with the Demons.
                Therefore, he hated darkness, joined the Monastery of Light, and swore to destroy all Demons.
                But later he learned the hidden secrets of this battle, so he left the Monastery of Light in anger and fought the darkness in his own way.</p>
